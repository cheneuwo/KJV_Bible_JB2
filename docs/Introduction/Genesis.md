# {ref}`GENESIS<GENESIS>`

The book of beginnings: The first part describes the creation of the physical university and of man ({ref}`1<GENESIS_1>`--{ref}`2<GENESIS_2>`), and then tells how man's first sin brought disaster in the form of a universal floor ({ref}`3<GENESIS_3>`--{ref}`8<GENESIS_8>`). Only {ref}`Noah<WHO_Noah>` and his family survived, and from them the whole human race is descended ({ref}`9<GENESIS_9>`--{ref}`11<GENESIS_11>`; see captions on page {ref}`9<GENESIS_9>`--{ref}`13<GENESIS_13>`). The second part of the book ({ref}`12<GENESIS_12>`--{ref}`50<GENESIS_50>`) contains the story of the earliest ancestors of the people of Israel: the patriarchs {ref}`Abraham<WHO_Abraham>` ({ref}`12<GENESIS_12>`--{ref}`23<GENESIS_23>`); see map on page 16), {ref}`Isaac<WHO_Isaac>` ({ref}`24<GENESIS_24>`--{ref}`26<GENESIS_26>`), and {ref}`Jacob<WHO_Jacob>` ({ref}`27<GENESIS_27>`--{ref}`36<GENESIS_36>`). Included are the narratives of the destruction of [Sodom and Gomorrah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodom_and_Gomorrah) ({ref}`19<GENESIS_19>`), the sacrifice of {ref}`Isaac<WHO_Isaac>` ({ref}`22<GENESIS_22>`), {ref}`Jacob<WHO_Jacob>`'s deceiving of his brother {ref}`Esau<WHO_Esau>` ({ref}`27<GENESIS_27>`), and Jacob's wrestling with the angel ({ref}`32<GENESIS_32>`:22--32). The book concludes with the story of {ref}`Joseph<WHO_Joseph>`, the son of {ref}`Jacob<WHO_Jacob>`, who, sold into bondage by his brothers, rose to power in Egypt and later used his power to save them ({ref}`37<GENESIS_37>`--{ref}`50<GENESIS_50>`; see caption on page 42).
